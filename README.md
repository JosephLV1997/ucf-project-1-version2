# Visions of Albion band website

The aim of this website is to provide a fresh platform for Visions of Albion rather than just having pages on social media pages. The purpose is to showcase videos and photos. In addition, there is also an aim to showcase future upcoming tours for the band itself detailing times/dates and locations. 
 
## UX
 
Who is the website for?

A duo called Visions of Albion that consists of two members; Daniel and Samantha.

Who is the target audience?

The target audience will be fans of the duo who will want to be able to view the detailing, history and any videos/music that the duo will have to offer.

The initial plan was to start the website from scratch by using a plan drawn up on hard copy paper and then to build it on the website. Although substantial progress was made it came to be that making the project responsive proved too much of a demanding task and it would be more prudent to seek out a template that was already available on w3schools which had been specifically tailored to accommodate a musical group.
User actions – 
•	Be able to select sections via the nav bar and access the sections respective to the section name.
•	Be able to play YouTube videos within the site to view VOA songs/videos.
•	Showcase the band and its history through slideshow on the first section.
•	Showcase individuals from the duo on the band section via two separate photos and a caption pointing out who is who.
•	Have social media links that will be able to point anywhere but also to point more particularly to the bands Facebook page. 


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
